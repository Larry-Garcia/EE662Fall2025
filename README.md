# WSN Simulator - Graph Generation Branch (`gengraphs`)

This branch (`gengraphs`) contains the simulation source code used to generate the figures and graphs for the associated paper.

## Branch Overview

*   **`gengraphs` (Current)**: Includes all graphing and figure generation capabilities (`papergraph5.py`, etc.). It serves as the reference implementation for the visualization components.
*   **`main`**: Contains a more refined and maintainable protocol implementation but does not yet include the full visualization features found here.

**Note:** Both branches share equivalent core protocol logic. This branch is preserved to allow reproduction of the paper's experimental results and figures.
